# Blockchain for Industrial Applications Community Of Interest
> A public-private collaboration

The Blockchain for Industrial Applications (BIA) Community of Interest (COI) of Interest wants to advance research and development initiatives that combine blockchain’s core strength of trust making with smart cloud-based solutions to advance blockchain-enabled smart manufacturing and other industrial applications. The BIA COI – with members from government, industry, and academia – is providing guidelines to create a (better) synergy between end users, research community, and solution providers to reduce complexity, cost, and delay of adoption of blockchain technologies. The following list defines the current scope of the BIA COI's focus on blockchain for industrial applications:
* Education: highlighting results to the community from research and scientific discoveries of blockchain technologies and added value to industrial applications
* Use case management: identifying use cases where blockchain technology can enhance the productivity and reliability of services within supply chain era
* Validation: developing guidelines and metrics for organizations to evaluate use cases and software solutions against their own business requirements
* Dissemination: developing a public knowledge repository to share results (e.g., source code, tutorial videos, peer-reviewed articles)
* Communication: providing a platform for different stakeholders to find each other, exchange ideas/needs/feedback, ensure goals are met, and foster innovation

<!-- ## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
packagemanager install awesome-project
awesome-project start
awesome-project "Do something!"  # prints "Nah."
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements. 


## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/awesome-project.git
cd awesome-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* What's the main functionality
* You can also do another thing
* If you get really randy, you can even do this

## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

#### Argument 1
Type: `String`  
Default: `'default value'`

State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide
an example below.

Example:
```bash
awesome-project "Some other value"  # Prints "You're nailing this readme!"
```

#### Argument 2
Type: `Number|Boolean`  
Default: 100

Copy-paste as many of these as you need.
